<p>Mutations accumulate in every cell of our body throughout life. There are processes that come from within, such as those happening by chance and through the cell's metabolic processes. In addition they occur induced by the environment, such as through UV radiation in our skin, through smoking, or also inflammatory processes. Most mutations are of little consequence and just accumulate in the 3 billion letters of our DNA without affecting a gene. But some may hit important genes and disrupt their function. This contributes to ageing, and may also lead for cells to become cancerous. They then develop mechanisms to accumulate more mutations and through deactivating protective genes they may develop a hypermutator phenotype. Also most cancer treatments, chemo- and radiotherapy are based on the principle that they damage DNA. They are very efficient in curing cancer and it is very hard to find better alternatives. But, also the treatment is causing additional mutations - not only in the possibly surviving cancer cells, but in healthy cells as well. As a consequence, the treatments are causing long term side effects, such as contributing to ageing, but also risks of developing a different cancer later in life.</p>
<p>Through research, childhood cancer treatment has improved significantly over the last decades. The large majority of pediatric cancer patients now survive the disease, mostly thanks to harsh regimens of chemo-, and radiotherapy. We are interested to better understand the principles behind these treatments to find ways to reduce the long-term side affects and risks for treatment related secondary cancers.</p>

<p>One route to mutagenesis is through oxidative damage to the DNA. This can happen through normal cellular processes that produce oxygen radicals, but also through toxins and ionising radiation, such as radioactivity. It acts through adding an oxygen to mainly Gs in the DNA. This has the risk of causing a mutation from the G to a T, which - dependent on where it happens in the genome - has more or less consequences. To prevent this, all of our cells have a repair system (base excision repair) that functions by cutting out the damaged G with the enzyme OGG1 to leave a gap, an apurinic site (AP-site). This gap is then filled through a longer process by an undamaged G.</p>
<p>We are trying to understand this process and how it happens dependent on the location in the genome, how this differs between tissues, and how oxidative DNA damage in repair leads a cross-talk with other mechanisms that lead to mutations. This is relevant both in response to treatment, and also in the development of many cancer types with mutations that are induced by these processes, such as neuroblastoma, pediatric brain tumours, and cancer types that are linked to inflammatory processes, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma and obesity associated colon cancer.</p>
<p>To understand these processes we are developing molecular biological techniques to measure DNA damage, we are building computational techniques to analyse the resulting data and large amounts of cancer genome sequencing data. In addition we use machine learning techniques to simulate the processes and predict what will happen, if we change treatment, for example.</p>
<p>While this is our main focus, we also work on additional projects around DNA damage, repair, and mutagenesis and functional genomics in pediatric cancer through collaborations with other groups.</p>
