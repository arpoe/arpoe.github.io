<p>We are on the lookout for new computational team members, a postdoctoral fellow in computational biology and a PhD student.</p>

<p>We are looking for a highly motivated computational biologist. The successful candidate will use machine learning to investigate genome specificity behind mechanisms of DNA damage, repair and mutagenesis. This exciting opportunity is embedded in an interdisciplinary group with the local expertise ranging from biochemistry via functional genomics to machine learning.<br>
<br>
We offer:
<li> Training and commitment for further career development </li>
<li> Friendly and collaborative work environment </li>
<li> Possibilities for interdisciplinary collaboration </li>
<br>
The postdoctoral fellow will use machine learning and deep learning data analysis techniques to investigate the behaviour of mutagenic mechanisms and interrogate the mechanistic basis for their specificity in the genome. <br>
The successful candidate will be expected to also collaborate closely with other members of the Biomedical Genomics group as well as clinical and/or molecular biological collaborating groups.<br>
<br>
Tasks:
<li> Lead specific research project; </li>
<li> Perform expert analysis of cancer genomics and functional genomics data; </li>
<li> Develop and apply machine learning techniques to these kinds of data; </li>
<li> Contribute to collaborative projects within the lab and with collaborating labs; </li> 
<li> Assist with organisational tasks; </li>
<li> Assist with supervision of junior lab members; </li>
<li> Participate and contribute to lab meetings; </li>
<li> Lead and contribute to the preparation of scientific manuscripts. </li>
<br>
Requirements:
The post holder should be eager to perform science in an interdisciplinary, collaborative and happy lab, in addition to the following:<br>
<li> university and PhD degree in a relevant subject with an extensive analytical component e.g. bioinformatics, cancer genomics, statistics, molecular biology or mathematics or other areas relevant to computational biology; </li>
<li> An understanding of programming in a higher-level language (R/C/C++/Python), particularly with regard to big data, data visualisation and machine learning techniques; </li>
<li> Experience in bioinformatics or a related biological field, with applying statistical techniques to biological data; </li>
<li> A basic knowledge of genomics and/or general molecular biology; </li>
<li> A broad comprehension of high throughput genomic technologies; </li>
<li> Demonstrable experience of cancer genomics and functional genomics analysis methodologies data analysis will be an asset; </li>
<li> Excellent communication skills within an interdisciplinary research environment; </li>
<li> Excellent scientific analysis skills; </li>
<li> Excellent oral and writing skills in the English language (German is not required). </li>
<br>

To apply, please send a detailed CV, bibliography, cover letter and the name of two references by 07.08.2020 as a single pdf to anna.poetsch@tu-dresden.de.<br>
