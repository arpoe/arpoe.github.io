<p>We are a young and still small group studying the genomics of DNA damage, repair, and mutagenesis in pediatric cancer and in response to therapy. We are using a combination of computational biology, machine learning, and molecular biological methods to be able to understand the complexity of the underlying mechanisms. The aim is on the one hand to prevent pediatric cancer in the first place, where possible, and on the other hand to use deregulated mechanisms to improve treatment strategies. Finally, we try to understand the currently used treatment strategies better in order to prevent long term adverse side effects.</p> 
<p>The group has recently started out at St.Anna-Childhood Cancer Research Institute in Vienna. Within pediatric cancers we are focussing mainly on genome instability in neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma and pediatric brain tumours, as well as genome instability and the generation of mutations in response to chemo- and radiotherapy treatment regimens that are typically used for pediatric cancer.</p>

        <p>Anna moved to Vienna in September 2018 to build up her own group. Before joining the CCRI, she was at the Francis Crick Institute, University College London, and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) as a postdoc with Nicholas Luscombe. She did her PhD with Christoph Plass at the German Cancer Research Institute (DKFZ) and her undergraduate training at University Konstanz, the Japanese National Cancer Center Reasearch Institute, and ALTANA Pharma AG.</p>
