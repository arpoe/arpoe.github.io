<p>We study the genomics of DNA damage, repair, and mutagenesis in pediatric cancer and in response to therapy. Using a combination of computational biology, machine learning, and molecular biological methods we try to understand the underlying mechanisms despite their complexity. The aim is on the one hand to prevent pediatric cancer, where possible, and on the other hand to use deregulated mechanisms to improve treatment strategies. Finally, we try to understand currently used chemo- and radiotherapy better in order to prevent long term adverse side effects.</p> 
<p>The group has recently started out at St.Anna-Childhood Cancer Research Institute in Vienna. Within pediatric cancers we focus mainly on genome instability in neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and pediatric brain tumours, as well as associated therapies.</p>
