This collaboration with <a href="http://http://luscombelab.org">Nick Luscombe</a> and <a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/paola-scaffidi">Paola Scaffidi</a> has been published as Chakrabarti et al. [Target-Specific Precision of CRISPR-Mediated Genome Editing. Molecular Cell, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.11.031). We found that  
• The outcome of CRISPR-mediated editing can be predicted.   
• Not all target sites are edited in a predictable manner.  
• The precision of DNA editing is mainly determined by the fourth nucleotide upstream of the PAM site.  
• Chromatin states affect editing of imprecise, but not precise, target sites.  

We have since used the convolutional neural networks that were developped in this project for other questions and developped them further. Through additional collaborations we still pursue the question of how CRISPR dependent genome editing can become more specific, precise, and predictable.
