I moved to Dresden in July 2020 to build this group. Before, I was starting my independence at St.Anna Childrens Cancer Research Institute in Vienna after a postdoc as a fellow of the [Peter and Traudl Engelhorn Foundation](https://engelhorn-stiftung.de) at the Francis Crick Institute with Nicholas Luscombe. My postdoctoral time also included a placement at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST). I did my PhD with Christoph Plass at the German Cancer Research Institute (DKFZ) and my undergraduate training at University Konstanz, the Japanese National Cancer Center Reasearch Institute, and ALTANA Pharma AG.  
My background is in classical biochemistry and DNA damage response. My interest in the associated processes has not changed, but the methodology became increasingly computational.
