We plan to adapt the novel techniques of genomic oxidative DNA damage measurements to achieve single cell resolution. Such an approach would allow us to open a new field and interrogate the action of oxidative DNA damage in single cell resolution and this way distinguish between cell cycle stages, differentiation state, and identity. This approach is of particular interest for hematopoietic cells in the context of radiation or chemotherapy treatment, where different susceptibility and genome specificity to the DNA damaging agent may reveal mechanistic details for the route to mutagenesis.
