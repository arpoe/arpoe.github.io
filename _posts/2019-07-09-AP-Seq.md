Oxidative DNA damage is distributed heterogenously over the genome. We could find that oxidative DNA damage is reduced in regulatory and protein coding areas, regions that have very high GC content. This study was made possible through the development of AP-seq, a method to measure AP-sites and indirectly base adducts genome wide. Anna has developed this method and the associated data analysis techniques during her postdoc with <a href="http://luscombelab.org">Nick Luscombe</a> and <a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/simon-boulton">Simon Boulton</a>. The primary paper is published as [Genomic landscape of oxidative DNA damage and repair reveals regioselective protection from mutagenesis. Genome Biology, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-018-1582-2).  
The method, AP-seq was then developped further and can be used for multiple questions assessing AP-sites genome wide, for total quantification, and at target regions. Using glycosylases to induce additional secondary AP-sites in vitro, the method can in principle be used to assess any base modification that can specifically be excised by a glycosylase.  
To complement the oxidative DNA damage measurements, we are also collaborating on projects looking at oxidative DNA damage on the mutation level. If you would like to collaborate on this, or if you would like to use our tools, please get in touch.  

Please stay tuned, because additional publications from this project are coming up:  
• Genomics of oxidative DNA damage, repair, and mutagenesis. Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal, coming end of 2019  
• AP-seq, a method to measure apurinic sites and small base adducts genome-wide. Methods in Molecular Biology, coming end of 2019
