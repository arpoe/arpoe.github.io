We are looking into mechanisms of mutagenesis in personalised oncology in several systems and contexts. Dysfunctional DNA repair is one of the main reasons for genetic predisposition to pediatric cancer. Yet, it is little taken into account in the treatment regimens, leading to severe side effects and secondary cancers in these patients.    
Looking into which pathways are deregulated and how this can be taken into account clinically, is one area we are planning to work more closely with clinical groups.  
Also somatic deregulation of DNA repair is of very high interest, as such mechanisms of deregulation can frequently be used for targeted cancer tharapy through synthetic lethal approaches with DNA repair inhibitors. Using pattern differentiation on genome sequencing data sets, the mutagenic history of a cancer can be reconstructed and somatic DNA repair defects become apparent. There are however multiple algorithmical challenges that make a tranlational use of such techniques difficult. We are looking deeper into such processes, specifically in esophageal adenocarcinoma and paediatric brain tumours.   
Finally, with the approaches to find predictive and prognostic biomarkers, the systems quickly become very complex, where general machine learning and deep learning come in handy. We are therefore also collaborating with clinical and computational groups to help developing such methodology.
