The DNA damage response has followed methroughout my career, with my first papers on the effect of deficiency of poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase (PARG).
PARG is the degrading enzyme for the polymer generated by PARP1 and interestingly silenced as a mechanism of PARP-inhibitor resistance, which based on our previous work, should render the PARPi resistant tumours chemo- and radiosensitive.   
[PARG dysfunction enhances DNA double strand break formation in S-phase after alkylation DNA damage and augments different cell death pathways. Cell Death and Disease, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.048)  
[Parg deficiency confers radio-sensitization through enhanced cell death in mouse ES cells exposed to various forms of ionizing radiation. Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2013.133)  

Through several collaborations, understanding the DNA damage response is continued through a genomics perspective. Here we are looking into several genes in collaborations, e.g. [ATMIN](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08711) in collaboration with [Axel Behrens](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/simon-boulton/), NUDT16L1 (Tirr) with [Dipanjan Chowdhury](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/dipanjan-chowdhury-phd/), Rtel1 with Simon Boulton (https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/simon-boulton/) and others with Evi Soutoglu (http://www.igbmc.fr/soutoglou/).  
Please stay tuned, there are several publications coming out soon.
