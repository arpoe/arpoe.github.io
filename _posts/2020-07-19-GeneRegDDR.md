The DNA damage response has followed me throughout my career, starting with my first papers on the effect of deficiency of poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase (PARG).
PARG is the degrading enzyme for the polymer generated by PARP1 and interestingly silenced as a mechanism of PARP-inhibitor resistance. Based on our previous work, this should render the PARPi resistant tumours chemo- and radiosensitive.   
[PARG dysfunction enhances DNA double strand break formation in S-phase after alkylation DNA damage and augments different cell death pathways. Cell Death and Disease, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.048)  
[Parg deficiency confers radio-sensitization through enhanced cell death in mouse ES cells exposed to various forms of ionizing radiation. Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2013.133)  

Through several collaborations, we continue to increase our understanding of the DNA damage response through a genomics perspective. Here we are focussing on several genes with different past and present collaborators, e.g. [ATMIN](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08711) in collaboration with [Axel Behrens](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/simon-boulton/), NUDT16L1 (Tirr) with [Dipanjan Chowdhury](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/dipanjan-chowdhury-phd/), RTEL1 with [Simon Boulton](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/simon-boulton/) and others with [Evi Soutoglou](http://www.igbmc.fr/soutoglou/).  

Please stay tuned, there are several publications on the way.
