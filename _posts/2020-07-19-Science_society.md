## By what mechanisms does SARS-CoV2 mutate?  
Using the algorithms we are using in cancer genomics, we are also addressing by which mechanisms SARS-CoV2 mutates, whether there are regional differences or differences dependent on the clade of the virus.
We started the project with the help of the Wir-vs-Virus Hackathon and also with COVID19 crowd science approaches.
Now all we need is the funding for extra people to finish it up and the resources to build an interactive web platform that scientists and non-scientists can use.   
Stay tuned, there are interesting things to come. 

## Do vaccines contain dangerous amounts of mercury?
There is so much misinformation out there. I think as scientists we have the responsibility to put some things streight with factual information.  
I'll start with the argument of the anti-vaccination movement that the amount of mercury, which is used as a preservative in vaccines, may be harmful. Please feel free to share the infographic.

## What's in a Genome?
Together with Nick Luscombe and Nick Peel, we have written a blogpost for the Cancer Research UK Science Blog with the Title <a href="https://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/05/21/whats-in-a-genome/">What's in a Genome?</a> It discusses how we study the human genome, the challenges and chances of genome sequencing.
