Our convolutional neural net CoNaN has been trained so far on 5887 whole genome sequenced samples to predict how mutation rates to hit particular elements in the genome with a certain degree of specificity. This is dependent on the combination of acting mutagenic mechanisms, the underlying tissue, and the driver genes acting on a particular tumour sample.  
We are refining this network to incorporate additional datasets and more data, e.g. known treatments. Ultimately we plan to incorporate tissue specific epigenetic data and achive single nucleotide resolution to assign condition specific mutation risks for each position in the genome.   
However, currently we are using simulations to understand the rules, which the network has learned so far with the objective to get biological insight into the mechanisms of specificity. Transfer-learning may also allow us to predict action of these mechanisms also in tissues for which we have limited ressources, such as sample numbers, information on treatment or particular driver mutations.
